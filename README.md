# Bike-Sharing-Project

This project is focusing on utilizing Tableau on the large datasets provided by Citi Bike.

Tableau public is required on your local machine. Datasets can be found at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

Purpose of this project :

Creating visualization analyis to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal

1. Used the Panda to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:

	•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
	•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
	•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Results:


Using tableau I created 7 different visualizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration. Here's what we found:
	•	There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.
	•	From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.
	•	There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.
	•	The largest number of individuals happen to be male, the women users don’t have as large of a peak and unknown users do not have a peak for tripduration.
	•	If you look at my trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.

Summery :
	•	CitiBike Analysis tells that there are way more Subscribers, then regular non-Subscribers, that data creates a new need, such better user experience interaction in the future.
